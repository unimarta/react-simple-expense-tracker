#React simple expense tracker

Expense tracker is a React application that allows us to add expenses and filter them by a year. After selecting a year, the user can see a list of expenses and a year chart presenting the expenses month by month.

This application was the first project of "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" - a Udemy Course by Maximilian Schwarzmiller.
